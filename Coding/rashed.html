	<p>It is expected that the bridge will contribute to nearly two percent of GDP in our economy. <b>According to conventional economic analysis, the accumulative effects on GDP could be traced </b> as follows. Ease of transportation will create new business opportunities for the agricultural and industrial sectors. This will generate a new investment hub for both local and foreign investors, which in turn will lead to the establishment of new industrial units resulting in numerous employment opportunities. As demand for labour increases, there will be more recruitment, reskilling or up-skilling of the labour force according to industrial needs and a possible rise in wages. The wider economic opportunities will eventually alleviate poverty, raise living standards and produce intergenerational gains through greater affordability of education and healthcare.</p>

<p> <b> <i> <u>The construction of the Padma Bridge is expected to be completed by 2022, making it the 122nd longest bridge in the world and the longest bridge in Bangladesh. This marvelous infrastructure has opened the doors of great potential, especially for the marginalised populations in the southern-west parts of Bangladesh. It will contribute substantially to the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) through the creation of strong supply chains that will enhance investment, external and internal trade, employment generation and poverty alleviation, and eventually better the socioeconomic status of the people in that region. </u>  </i> </b> </p>
